# Stock Prediction
Stock Price Prediction using the Sentiment Analysis of Twitter Data.
The goal of this project is to successfully predict the price of stocks from Twitter data using the ML model through sentiment analysis algorithms.

In this study, we examine the relationship between stock market movements of a firm and sentiments in tweets using sentiment analysis and supervised machine learning methods such as KNN, MLP Re- gressor and Bayesian Ridge on tweets retrieved from Twitter. In a complicated way, good press and tweets on social media about a firm would undoubt- edly entice individuals to buy its stock, which would raise the stock price of that company.It is demon- strated at the conclusion of the study that there is a significant link between changes in stock prices and the opinions expressed in tweets by the general audience and results revealed that stock price can be anticipated with 69.71% r2 score with K Nearest Neighbors as the most precise predictive model.
